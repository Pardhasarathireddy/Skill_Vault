        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Skill Vault is a platform to showcase the skills of Vignan students...</p>
	<p> In todayâ€™s competitive job market, traditional academic metrics often fall  short 
in accurately representing a student's true potential and skills. To address  this gap, 
we propose the development of a comprehensive application designed to catalog 
and showcase the technical and non-technical skills of students from our institution. 
The information about students will be collected and maintained by the college 
management based on various tests and observations. This platform will serve as a 
bridge between students and potential recruiters or internship providers by 
providing a detailed profile of each student's competencies, projects, and 
achievements beyond academic performance. By enabling students to highlight 
their unique skills and experiences, the application aims to enhance their visibility 
to potential employers seeking talented individuals with practical expertise. </p>
